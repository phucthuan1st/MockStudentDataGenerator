## For this project, we use these following library:
1. string
2. ctime
3. vector
4. fstream
5. memory
6. tuple
7. utility

## What we have done:
- Generate a random number
- Generate n mock up student randomly
- Read and write data file 
- Display average GPA of all student
- Print out all student that have GPA greater than average

## To compile and build this project, you should follow these instruction:
1. Clone this repository to your local
```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/phucthuan1st/MockStudentDataGenerator/
```
If your PC do not have git yet, just install it [Git install instruction](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

2. Start a command promt or terminal in your folder repository (or using cd command)
```shellcript
cd ./MockStudentDataGenerator/
```

3. Compile source file using c++ compiler (such as mingw c++ as below)
```shellscript
g++ classImplementation.cpp Main.cpp -o ./Release/MockupStudentDataGenerator
```
You can also compile it by MSVC in VS too

4. Open executive file in Release folder or type command to terminal: 
```shellscript
./Release/MockupStudentDataGenerator
```

  You can combine step 3 and 4 like following:
  ```shellscript
  g++ classImplementation.cpp Main.cpp -o ./Release/MockupStudentDataGenerator ; ./Release/MockupStudentDataGenerator
  ```
  
## For bonus:
- We use github to manage our code from the beginning of this project, because we think it will useful for further career.
- We use some design pattern
- We build everything in class
We think we could get a bit of bonus ðŸ¤£
  
## Expected grade
  We share same role, and do complete the project, so we expect to get 10 for each

You can see a mini demo of this project in this link [Youtube Demo](https://youtu.be/5cBwlccaYnk) or [Youtube Rick roll](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Note
You can use the execution file in ./Release without compile it by do step 1 & 2, then do step 4
```shellscript
git clone https://github.com/phucthuan1st/MockStudentDataGenerator
```

```shellscript
cd ./MockStudentDataGenerator
```

```shellscript
./Release/MockupStudentDataGenerator
```
